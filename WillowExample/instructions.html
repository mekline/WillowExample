<h3> Instructions</h3>
<h3> Part 1 </h3>
<p class="blocktext"> You will now see a series of 18 short movies and answer memory questions about them.  Each time, you will see a video of an event, and then be given a short distracting task (solving simple math problems.)  
Then you will see another movie of a similar event.  Some of the videos will be exactly the same as the first movie, and some will have changed slightly.  Your task is to decide for each whether it was exactly the same as the first 
movie you saw ('Same'), or was different in some way ('Different'). </p>

<p class="blocktext"> The movies are very short, and the presentations are timed.  Do not click away from this tab during the experiment.  If you are looking away, or if a movie doesn't display correctly, click the "I missed it" button.</p>

<p class="blocktext"> At the end of the test movie you just watched, you should have seen a plus sign on a black background, like this:</p>

<div>
<img src="fixationcross.jpg" height=150 width=200>
</div>

<p class="blocktext"> You should see this symbol at the end of every movie at least for a moment - this lets you know that your browser is playing all the way to the end of the movie.  If you do NOT see this symbol at the end of a movie, please click the "I missed it" button. </p>

<p class="blocktext"><i> This is a DINOSAUR MOUNTAIN SURVEY.  Please complete only one HIT from this group.  You will not be paid for completing more than one DINOSAUR MOUNTAIN survey (including surveys taken in previous HIT groups.)</i> </p>

<p class="blocktext"> Click the button below when you are ready to start watching the videos.</p>
